This is a companion project to The App Brewery's Complete App Development Bootcamp, check out the full course at [www.appbrewery.co](https://www.appbrewery.co/)

Started out with this default template and was able to get through the module, but wanted to tweak around with choices and have fun with it!

Things I learned from this project:
- Re-adjusted myself to basics of Swift
- Learned more about MVC Design Pattern and Swift Structures
- Got familiar with mutating functions
